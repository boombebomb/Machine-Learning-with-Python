# Machine-Learning-with-Python
This repository contains my solutions to the challenges from the "Machine Learning with Python" course provided by freeCodeCamp. Throughout the course, I've delved into a variety of machine learning concepts, from fundamental models to advanced techniques, using the TensorFlow framework. The course covered everything from basic linear regression and classification to more complex topics like convolutional neural networks, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.

I am grateful to freeCodeCamp for providing this comprehensive and insightful machine learning course. The challenges and projects enabled me to gain hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of various machine learning techniques.
Course Overview

In this course, I gained proficiency in the following areas:

    Basic Machine Learning Models:
        Linear Regression
        Classification
        Clustering
    Advanced Topics Explored:
        Neural Networks
        Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
        Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
        Natural Language Processing (NLP)
        Deep Learning
        Reinforcement Learning
        Projects Completed

Throughout the course, I successfully completed the following machine learning projects:
1. Cat and Dog Image Classifier

In this project, I designed and implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of cats and dogs. The model's training and validation were carried out using TensorFlow, and the resulting model can effectively distinguish between these two popular pet categories.
2. Book Recommendation Engine using KNN

For this project, I undertook the task of building a Book Recommendation Engine. After preprocessing the dataset, I constructed a K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to provide personalized book recommendations based on user preferences.
3. Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator

Here, I leveraged linear regression to develop a model capable of predicting healthcare expenses. Through data analysis and feature engineering, I created a model that can estimate the costs associated with health treatments.
4. Neural Network SMS Text Classifier

In this project, I implemented a neural network model for sentiment classification of SMS messages. By training the model on a labeled dataset, it can effectively differentiate between legitimate messages (ham) and spam messages.
